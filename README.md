## About Exercism ##
From the exercism.io about page:
* Download and solve practice problems in over 30 different languages.
* Submit the solution to the site for feedback (beta).
* For code newbies and experienced programmers.

* Exercism provides countless small wins. The exercises are achievable mini-quests: small and well-defined, and with enough complexity to uncover bite-sized knowledge gaps.
* The solutions you write provide reviewers with clues about what you haven't grasped yet. The feedback you receive will guide you to relevant study topics and dramatically increase the ease with which you write code.
