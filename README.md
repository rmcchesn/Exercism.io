## About Exercism ##
From the exercism.io about page:
* Download and solve practice problems in over 30 different languages.
* Submit the solution to the site for feedback (beta).
* For code newbies and experienced programmers.

* Exercism provides countless small wins. The exercises are achievable mini-quests: small and well-defined, and with enough complexity to uncover bite-sized knowledge gaps.
* The solutions you write provide reviewers with clues about what you haven't grasped yet. The feedback you receive will guide you to relevant study topics and dramatically increase the ease with which you write code.

Please refer to [exercism.io](http://exercism.io/) to create free account and solve problems.


## Submission Guide ##
* Once initial setup complete:
  * Fetch new problem with `exercism fetch languageofchoice`
  * Submit specific problem with `exercism submit hello-world.js`

## 12in23 Challenge
### March - recommended exercises
We also have five featured exercises to try:
* Linked-list or simple-linked-list (depending on the language): allocating/freeing memory, pointers
* secret-handshake: bitwise operations
* ~~pangram: for loops, strings and characters~~
* sieve: arrays, for loops
* binary-search: arrays, loops

### February - recommended exercises
Now for many people the most important question is how to get the Functional February badge! Well it’s pretty simple! Choose one of those languages I just mentioned and solve and publish five exercises in it! You can choose any exercises to solve other than “Hello World”, but we’re recommending five in particular that you try at some point during the month. Those are:
* Hamming (to explore higher order functions)
* Collatz-conjecture (to practise recursion)
* Robot Simulator (to play with immutability)
* both Yacht and Protein Translation (for pattern matching and higher order functions).
All those are listed on the #12in23 page so you can check that later!
